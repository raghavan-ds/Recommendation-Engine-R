#1) Reading Dataset

```{r}
#Importing datasets
beer_data <- read.csv('./beer_data.csv',na.strings = "")
print(dim(beer_data))

#Checking for duplicates
beer_data <- unique(beer_data)
print(dim(beer_data))

#Print summary
summary(beer_data)
```

#2) Exploration- 

### How are ratings distributed?
```{r}
ggplot(data = beer_data, aes(x = factor(review_overall))) + 
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title="No.of ratings given to beers", x="Rating", y="Frequency") +
  theme(text = element_text(size=16),axis.text = element_text(size=16))
```

### Distribution of Average rating by user?
```{r}
x <- beer_data %>%
  group_by(review_profilename) %>%
  summarise(ratings_mean = mean(review_overall))
##How are rating distributed
ggplot(data = x, aes(x = ratings_mean)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 10) +
  labs(title="Average ratings given by a user", x="Rating", y="Frequency") +
  theme(text = element_text(size=16),axis.text = element_text(size=16))
```

Most people rate beer highly. 

### Distribution of nummber of rating given to a beer?
```{r}
beer_wise_count <- beer_data %>%
  group_by(beer_beerid) %>%
  summarise(rating_count = length(review_overall))

summary(beer_wise_count)

ggplot(data= beer_wise_count,aes(x=rating_count)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 20) +
  labs(title="Average number of ratings given to a beer", x="Rating count", y="Frequency") +
  theme(text = element_text(size=16),axis.text = element_text(size=16))
```

### Distribution of average number of rating given by a user?
```{r}
review_profilename_count <- beer_data %>%
  group_by(review_profilename) %>%
  summarise(rating_count = length(review_overall))

summary(review_profilename_count)

ggplot(data= review_profilename_count,aes(x=rating_count)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 20) +
  labs(title="Average number of ratings given by a user", x="Rating count", y="Frequency") +
  theme(text = element_text(size=16),axis.text = element_text(size=16))
```


### As we can see that only some beers have been rated many times while 75% of beer have less than 5 ratings. We will only use beers which atleast have more than 100 rating count. Let's check how much beers we would be convering.

```{r}
sprintf('Coverage : %s%%',round(sum(beer_wise_count$rating_count >= 100)*100 / nrow(beer_wise_count),2))
```

There are 2.53% of beers which have more than 100 ratings and we would be only interested in them. Recommender systems suffer with the problem of cold start and 100 is a good number to give appropriate recommendation. Let's filter our data for only these beers.

```{r}
beer_of_interest <- beer_wise_count[beer_wise_count$rating_count >= 100,'beer_beerid']

beer_data_filter <- merge(beer_data, beer_of_interest, by = 'beer_beerid')

sprintf('Drop in observations : %s%%',(round(100 - (nrow(beer_data_filter)*100/nrow(beer_data)),2)))
```

### As we can see by only taking 2.53% of beers recommendation we only loose 53.1% of rating data. Also filter users who have rated more than 10 ratings

```{r}
review_profilename_count <- beer_data_filter %>%
  group_by(review_profilename) %>%
  summarise(rating_count = length(review_overall))

user_of_interest <- review_profilename_count[review_profilename_count$rating_count > 10,'review_profilename']

beer_data_filter <- merge(beer_data_filter, user_of_interest, by = 'review_profilename')

sprintf('Drop in observations : %s%%',(round(100 - (nrow(beer_data_filter)*100/nrow(beer_data)),2)))
```

### OVerall drop in data is 60.8%

```{r}
#Removing observations with no username
beer_data_filter <- beer_data_filter[!is.na(beer_data_filter$review_profilename),]

#This step will take a lot of time and memory
beer_data_filter1 <- acast(beer_data_filter, review_profilename ~ beer_beerid,value.var = 'review_overall',fun.aggregate=mean)

#Converting NaN to zero
beer_data_filter1[is.na(beer_data_filter1) ] = 0

## Making a sparse matrix
rating_matrix <- Matrix(beer_data_filter1,sparse = TRUE)
print(dim(rating_matrix))
``` 

### That means 4336 users and 1020 beers. Now to convert the sparse matrix to a real rating matrix.
```{r}
real_matrix <- new("realRatingMatrix", data = rating_matrix)
```


### Let's visualize similarity between users and items
```{r}
#First 10 users
image(as.matrix(similarity(real_matrix[1:10,],method = 'cosine',which = 'users')))

#First 10 items
image(as.matrix(similarity(real_matrix[,1:10],method = 'cosine',which = 'items')))
```

Let's start by doing a split validation of 80% and 20% and build our UBCF & IBCF models. Given is setted as 10 as we filtered that each beer will have atleast 10 ratings and goodRating 3 which is mid of 1-5.

## Split Validation
```{r}
# Making evaluation data set with 80 - 20 splot
eval_sets <- evaluationScheme(real_matrix, method = "split",train = 0.8, given = 10,goodRating = 3)

#Defining models to be evaluated
models <- list(
IBCF_cos = list(name = "IBCF",parameter = NULL),
UBCF_cos = list(name = "UBCF",parameter = NULL)
)

#evaluation
eval_results <- evaluate(x = eval_sets,method = models,n=seq(1,19,2))

#Printing Model performance
print(eval_results$IBCF_cos@results[[1]])
print(eval_results$UBCF_cos@results[[1]])

#Making ROC curve 
plot(eval_results, annotate = 1:2, legend="topleft")
```

As we can see UBCF model do better than IBCF models.  

## Cross validation - 5 Fold
```{r}
#Making evaluation data set with 5 fold
eval_cv <- evaluationScheme(real_matrix, method="cross-validation",k=5,  given = 10, goodRating = 3)

#Evaluation
eval_results1 <- evaluate(x = eval_cv, method = models,n=seq(1,19,2))

#Printing model performance
print(eval_results1$IBCF_cos@results[[1]])
print(eval_results1$UBCF_cos@results[[1]])

#Making ROC curve
plot(eval_results1, annotate = 1:2, legend="topleft")
```


As we can see UBCF model do better than IBCF models even in cross validation approach.

## Making predictions using IBCF 
```{r}
#Building UBCF model
Rec.model=Recommender(real_matrix,method="UBCF")

#Making Predictions
recom <- predict(Rec.model,1:dim(real_matrix)[1],data = real_matrix,n=5)

# For cokes
as(recom, "list")$cokes
# For genog
as(recom, "list")$genog
# For giblet
as(recom, "list")$giblet
```
